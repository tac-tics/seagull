Seagull is a stenography theory for Plover.

Goals
-----
* Canonical outlines for all common English words.
* Explicit rules with programmatic checks to minimize violations.
* Word-based core. Punctionation and motions are separate.

Notes
-----
* Words should be explicitly marked when certain prefixes/suffixes apply.
* The theory should take a strong stance on how word boundaries work.
