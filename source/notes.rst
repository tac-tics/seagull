`Configuration Directory`_

Outline Checker
---------------
I want a solid outline-checker that can validate an outline string.

Extended Outline Syntax
-----------------------
This is done informally.
But it would be nice to have a set of rules which make this clear.

Having a name like "exo" (extended outline) would be good.


The outline for "back" would be `{B}A{Ck}` which will expand according to a set of rules.
These would only be for consonants.
