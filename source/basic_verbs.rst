Basic Verbs
===========

to be

* :steno:`be <PW>`
* :steno:`been <PW-PB>`
* :steno:`being <PW-G>`
* :steno:`am <APL>`
* :steno:`are <R>`
* :steno:`is <S>`
* :steno:`were <WR>`
* :steno:`was <W-S>`

.. note::

  "to be" verbs generally have their vowels dropped.
  Being one of those most common verbs in English, most are encoded with 1 or 2 key briefs.

to have

* :steno:`have <SHR>`
* :steno:`had <H-D>`
* :steno:`having <SHR-G>`
* :steno:`has <H-S>`

.. note::

  "to have" verbs generally have their vowels dropped.
  "have" is a bit weird in that it is an infold of `HV`.

to do

* :steno:`do <TKO>`
* :steno:`did <TKEUD>`
* :steno:`done <TKOEPB>`
* doing (need to disambiguate with "dog")
* `doing <TKOG>`

.. note::

  "to do" is straightforward.
  Note that "done" has an infolded `E` to remind us that it has an "e" in it (unlike :steno:`don <TKOPB>`).
